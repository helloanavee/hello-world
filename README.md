trying out git for the first time with github's hello world tutorial

Hi this is Ana!

And my goal in life is to make stuff I'm proud of, and stuff that makes people proud to use them. Whether it's art (Lego is my favorite medium) or web design or hair-braiding wizardry I am doing, I always want to make sure that they will bring joy, usefulness and value to those who see, feel and use them.

After doing a 3-month bootcamp on PHP (and other web dev magic), it's time I learn on my own about more techy magic like Git. This is my first attempt at Git and Github, the goal of which is to have a stepping stone on making more awesome web dev related projects in the future.
